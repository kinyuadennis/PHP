🧭 Staff Dashboard Management System

A simple **PHP-based staff authentication and dashboard system** that allows users (staff, managers, and admins) to log in and access specific roles and permissions based on their department.  
This project is designed to **strengthen backend logic and server-side programming skills in PHP**, focusing on how authentication, role-based access, and session management work in real systems.

## 🎯 Purpose & Motivation

The **main reason behind developing this site** is to:
- Practice and understand **backend business logic** in PHP beyond just syntax.
- Learn how to structure modular applications using **separation of concerns** (config, includes, public files).
- Implement a real-world **authentication module** (login, sessions, and role-based dashboards).
- Prepare for more complex backend systems such as **ERP, CRM, or company intranet portals**.
- Build a foundation for future integration with **APIs, databases, and admin panels**.

This project mirrors what a software engineer might build in small company systems — managing staff logins, department dashboards, and permissions.
